Perfect 👍
Since **README.md already exists**, you **do NOT need a full rewrite**.
You only need to **ADD / UPDATE sections** to reflect the **new files and code** you added (Profile, Counter, Features).

Below is the **UPDATED README.md content** with **minimal changes**, keeping your original text and **adding Day 4 & Day 5 info**.

👉 You can **replace your current README.md with this** safely.
