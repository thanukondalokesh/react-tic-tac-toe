Perfect 👍
Since **README.md already exists**, you **do NOT need a full rewrite**.
You only need to **ADD / UPDATE sections** to reflect the **new files and code** you added (Profile, Counter, Features).

Below is the **UPDATED README.md content** with **minimal changes**, keeping your original text and **adding Day 4 & Day 5 info**.

👉 You can **replace your current README.md with this** safely.

# React Tic Tac Toe 🎮

A simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe game** built using **React.js**.  
This project is created to practice React fundamentals such as components, state management, and event handling.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🎲 Tic Tac Toe Game
- Two-player game (X vs O)
- Displays current player turn
- Detects winner and draw condition
- Restart game functionality
- Clean and responsive UI
- Built using React Hooks (`useState`)

### 📘 Day 4: Props & State
- Reusable **Profile component** using props
- **Counter component** using `useState` hook
- Demonstrates state updates and component reusability

### 📗 Day 5: Events & Conditional Rendering
- Event handling using button clicks
- Conditional rendering using boolean state
- Rendering lists dynamically using `map()`

### 📅 Day 6: Forms – Controlled Components

**Deliverable:** User Registration Form

In this phase, a **User Registration Form** was implemented using **controlled components** in React.  
All input fields are fully managed by React state using the `useState` hook.

#### 📁 Component Added


#### 🔹 Key Concepts Covered
- Controlled components in React
- Form handling using `useState`
- Single state object to manage multiple inputs
- Event handling using `onChange` and `onSubmit`
- Preventing default form submission behavior

#### 🔹 How the Form Works
1. User enters data into input fields
2. `onChange` event updates React state
3. Input values are rendered from state
4. On submit, form data is captured as an object
5. Success message is displayed after submission

#### 🔹 Features Implemented
- Username, Email, and Password fields
- Reusable `handleChange` function
- Clean and readable form layout
- Ready for backend/API integration

#### 🎯 Learning Outcome
This task helped in understanding how React controls form inputs, manages user data efficiently, and handles form submissions in a structured way.
